          I receieved a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
          current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I
          got every penny's worth.

          "I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been
          looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had
          amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and
          found it incredibily fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
          weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since
          compleating the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as
          a Software Engineer at a VR start up."

          Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves.
          Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences were
          easy.

          "The staff seem genuinly concerned about my progress which I find
          really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence nescessary to be
          able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior
          developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal
          attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing
          people."

          "Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I
          needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
          programming step by step. I was encrouaged to enroll by a former
          studend of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program.
          The entire curriculum and staff did not dissapoint. They were very
          hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
          project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the
          next level in a way no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often
          referred to it during my interviews as an example of my development
          experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack
          developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommended!"
